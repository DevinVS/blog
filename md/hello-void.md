### How Did We Get Here?

I've wanted to start a blog for quite a while now, but there was one obstacle I couldn't overcome: I would make an awful blogger. I don't believe I have any particular deficiency that prevents me from successfully running a blog. Still, when I get down into what I would want my blog to look like, I realize the very things I want are antithetical to what makes blogs successful. Here's a couple:

1. I don't think of myself as a writer. I took English classes in high school and shoved out cookie-cutter essays to get a good enough grade, but I never felt like I learned to write in a free-form sense, or at least well enough for anyone to enjoy what I wrote.

2. I want to write long-form, highly researched posts full of logical reasoning and abstract ideas. Very few people search out this kind of material, and of the ones that do, how many engage and persevere through the entire article? I suspect that most people will quickly disengage and move on given interminable paragraphs full of dense arguments and ideas. Ironically, I rarely read a long article in its entirety and instead opt to skim through it, searching to glean basic facts and then move on with my life.

3. I don't want to be limited to a specific subject matter or topic of discussion. Many of the "successful" blogs I am aware of try to stick to a particular topic. If they write about tech, they write about tech. Politics? Politics. If I am limited, I will lose interest.

4. If I write about something too sensitive and misspeak or am misunderstood, the consequences could be somewhat devastating. Worse, what if my words were weaponized against me at a later date? It is easy to take someone's words out of context and make a bad faith argument. It is much harder for them to argue the contrary.

So how did we get here?

One day while considering these things, I came to a realization. The blog I want to write has no demographic, no audience. Even if I wrote it, the effort to market it and convince people to read it seemed so unappealing that my own unwillingness to put in that work would doom it to fail. I would be left shouting into the void with no one to hear what I was saying.

And that's when I realized shouting *into the void* was precisely what I wanted.

But, why?

Why would I want to write and maintain a blog if there was no one reading, no one who cared?

Well, I think there are a couple of reasons:

1. I can use the platform as a means to sharpen my writing skills. Without an audience, I can move past my fears of being a subpar writer and, through constant practice, hone my writing skills further. A quote from Macklemore's song "Ten Thousand Hours" has always stuck with me.
   > The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint.<br>
   > The greats were great because they'd paint a lot

   Maybe the same could be true for me, that through years of practice, I could write like the greats.

2. When I don't have to worry about audience retention rates, I can explore any topic with any depth. I don't have to care about what my readers want to read. I write what I want to write.

3. I have an avenue to speak and explore my thoughts without repercussions, good or bad. Since I remain anonymous with no audience, I remain isolated from the quick judgment of the masses. One fear I had starting a blog was being taken out of context or misunderstood and immediately canceled. This medium means I am free from those consequences.

So that is how we got to this moment, an introductory post to a blog with no readership. 

Thanks for listening.
