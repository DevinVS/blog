# it's been a minute

I had a pretty good plan when I stood up this site. I spend a lot of time building things and a lot of time thinking
about things, why not write them down? The concept seems simple enough, but as is obvious by the frequency of my posting
it has mostly been a failure.

I started this blog for primarily 2 reasons: I wanted a medium where I was free to express myself/my thoughts/my
interestes, and I wanted to become a better writer. I still want both of those things, so why didn't I write?

What paralyzed me the most was that I had an idealistic view of the content that I create and the quality that it must
have. The problem was not necessarily that I didn't write, I've "written" several articles since my last posting. They
were never good enough, or they weren't on brand, or whatever standard I had given for myself.

What this ultimately meant is that only the articles I write in the spur of the moment ever got posted. My carefully
planned ideas died to my high standards, while articles I wrote at 2 AM because I was excited about parsers were posted
immediately.

I want to be a better writer. I want to express my thoughts. I don't want to care about other
people's opinions. So here is my solution: I am going to write something once a week. It may be short. It may be
completely off-topic. It may be an absolute of time for any living, breathing person to read. The real value is in the
doing, so do I shall.
