### How Did We Get Here?

I've wanted to start a blog for quite a while now, but there was always a little bit of cognitive dissonance that held
me back from pulling the trigger: I would make an awful blogger. I don't believe I have any particular deficiency that
prevents me from successfully runnning a blog, but when I really get down into what I would want my blog to look like I
realize the very things I want are antithetical to what makes blogs successful.

1. I don't consider myself to be a very good writer. I took english classes in high school and shoved out cookie cutter
   essays to get a good enough grade, but I never felt like I learned to write in a free form sense, or at least well
   enough to keep peoples attention.

2. I want to write long form, highly researched posts full of logical reasoning and abstract ideas. Very few people
   search out this kind of material to begin with, and of the ones that do how many are able to engage and persevere
   through the entire article? Somewhat ironically, I rarely read an entire article and instead opt to skim through it,
   searching to glean basic facts and then move on with my life. My suspicion is that given interminable paragraphs full
   of dense arguments and ideas most people will quickly disengage and move on to simpler or more concise things.

3. I don't want to be limited to a certain subject matter or topic of discussion. I think a lot of the "successful"
   blogs I have seen all try to stay in their lane. If they write about tech, they write about tech. Politics? Politics.
   If I am limited I will lose interest.

That's a list of a few problems I could quickly bring to mind every time I considered starting a blog, but there were
more reasons and I probably will discover new ones as time goes on.

So how did we get here?

One day whilst considering these things I came to a realization. The blog I want to write has no demographic, no
audience. Even if I wrote it the effort to market it and convince people to read it seemed so unappealing that my own
unwillingness to put in that work would surely doom it to fail. I would be left shouting into the void with no one to
hear what I was saying.

And that's when I realized shouting into the void was exactly what I wanted.

But, why?

Why would I want to write and maintain a blog if there was no one reading, no one who cared?

Well I think there are a couple reasons:

1. I can use the platform as a means to sharpen my writing skills. Without an audience I can move past my fears of being
   a subpar writer and instead through constant practice hone this skill to a place I am more comfortable. There is a
   quote from Macklemore's song "Ten Thousand Hours" that has always stuck with me.
   > The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint.<br>
   > The greats were great because they'd paint a lot

   Maybe the same could be true for me, that through years of practice I could learn how to truly write.

2. When I don't have to worry about audience retention rates, I can explore any topic with any depth that I want. There
   are no boundaries, no topics that are off limits.

3. I have an avenue to speak and explore my thoughts without repurcussions, good or bad. Since I remain anonymous with
   no audience I remain isolated from the quick judgement of the masses. One fear I had with starting a blog is that I
   would be taken out of context, or misunderstood, and immediately cancelled. This medium means I am free from those
   consequences.

Now at least you have a general idea of why I started this blog, where I expect it to go. I hope in the next few days
I'll find the time to write my first "real" article, going over how I built this blog and my mentality in doing so.

Thanks for listening.
