        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Devin Vander Stelt and this is my blog. I am a Christian who is currently studying Computer
        Science, but my other interests include Music, Mathematics, Linux, Politics, Philosophy, and tackling hard
        issues. I started this blog because I felt like I was the only one who thinks the way I do (though this is most
        likely untrue) and wanted to have a medium to express and flesh out how I think about the world.</p>
